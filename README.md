## Typed.js

[View the live demo](http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) | [Original Author, mattboldt.com](http://www.mattboldt.com)

Typed.js is a library that types. Enter in any string, and watch it type at the speed you've set, backspace what it's typed, and begin a new sentence for however many strings you've set.

Looking for some custom use cases for Typed.js? [Check out the wiki](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/wiki)

## Development

`npm install`

Then, once you've made your edits:

`gulp`

This will build the javascript in `/js` and create a minified version and type declaration in `/dist`
